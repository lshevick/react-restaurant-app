# React Restaurant App
This is an ordering app for a sushi restaurant I made for my code school assignment. It was made with Create React App, and utilizes things I've learned from school. I also learned how to use localStorage with this project.

The user is able to select food from the menu and add it to their order. The order page has buttons for removing items and for placing the order. When the order is placed, it is added to localStorage. Below the order display, there is a section for seeing previous orders, and a button that pulls up the most recent order from localStorage.
